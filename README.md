# Clustering Techniques Comparison
This repository explores and compares several popular clustering techniques:

### K-Means
### Agglomerative Clustering
### DBSCAN
### Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
In the Clustering Techniques file, you'll find a comparison between these methods applied to 6 distinct simple datasets, along with visualizations to help understand their behavior and effectiveness.

# Project Overview: Customer Segmentation
The project focuses on Customer Segmentation, where the aforementioned clustering techniques were applied to segment a customer dataset. After applying clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to compare and analyze the results visually.

# Customer Segmentation Dataset
You can access the dataset used for this project from Kaggle:

Customer Segmentation Dataset

# Key Highlights:
Clustering Comparison: A direct comparison between clustering methods using six different datasets.
PCA Analysis: After applying the clustering algorithms, PCA was used to reduce dimensionality and visually compare the clustering results.
